# GoKarts Multiplayer Architecture

## Recommended Tech Stack

### Frontend (Current)
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - Keep current lightweight approach
- **Canvas 2D** - Sufficient for 2D racing
- **WebSocket Client** - Real-time communication

### Backend (Recommended)
- **Node.js + Express** - JavaScript consistency
- **Socket.io** - WebSocket with fallbacks
- **Redis** - Fast session/game state storage
- **PostgreSQL** - Persistent data (leaderboard, player stats)

## Deployment Strategy

### Vercel Frontend
- Static site hosting (perfect for your HTML/CSS/JS)
- Custom domain support
- Global CDN for fast loading

### Backend Options
1. **Railway** - Easy Node.js deployment, Redis/PostgreSQL included
2. **Render** - Good for real-time apps, WebSocket support
3. **DigitalOcean App Platform** - Scalable, database included
4. **AWS/Heroku** - More complex but highly scalable

## Multiplayer Stability Features

### 1. Authoritative Server
```
Client sends input → Server validates → Server updates game state → Broadcast to all clients
```

### 2. Lag Compensation
- **Client-side prediction** - Immediate input response
- **Server reconciliation** - Smooth corrections
- **Interpolation** - Smooth movement between updates

### 3. Game State Management
- Server maintains single source of truth
- 60 FPS server tick rate for smooth racing
- Client receives 30 FPS updates (sufficient for display)

### 4. Matchmaking System
- Queue players waiting for races
- Start races when 5 players found
- Handle disconnections gracefully

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Multiplayer (MVP)
- Simple WebSocket server
- Real-time position sync
- Basic race state management

### Phase 2: Stability
- Authoritative physics
- Lag compensation
- Reconnection handling

### Phase 3: Scale
- Multiple game rooms
- Load balancing
- Database optimization

## File Structure for Multiplayer
```
/server
  /src
    - server.js (main server)
    - gameManager.js (race logic)
    - playerManager.js (player handling)
    - database.js (DB connection)
  - package.json
  - Dockerfile

/client (current files)
  - index.html
  - styles.css
  - game.js (updated for WebSocket)
```

## Performance Considerations

### Network Optimization
- Send only position/rotation changes
- Compress data packets
- Batch updates for efficiency

### Server Performance
- Use Redis for fast game state access
- Database connection pooling
- Horizontal scaling with multiple server instances

### Client Performance
- Smooth interpolation between server updates
- Local physics prediction
- Efficient rendering (only redraw when needed)

## Security Considerations
- Validate all client inputs server-side
- Rate limiting on connections
- Anti-cheat: server validates all movements
- Secure WebSocket connections (WSS)

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Deploy current version to Vercel first
2. Create simple Node.js server for testing
3. Add WebSocket communication
4. Gradually move game logic server-side
5. Add database for persistent leaderboard
